1. Add IWEVGENIE in iwlist ra0 scan.
2. Add new WSC hardware push button function
3. Add Ad-Hoc to support N rate.
4. Add "iwpriv ra0 set CarrierDetect=0(or 1)"
5. Add Station N only mode in Infra mode. (Only connects to N-AP)
6. Add Global country domain (ch1-11:active scan, ch12-14 passive scan)
7. Fixed connection failed with Range Maximizer - 515 AP (Marvell Chip) when security is WPAPSK/TKIP.
8. Fixed crash in LinkDown when there are >64 APs exists.
9. Fixed compile error when CARRIER_DETECTION_SUPPORT is enabled.
10. Fixed suspend/resume error when ra0 down, ra0 up
11. Modified iwpriv ra0 get_site_survey: When security of AP is OPEN/WEP or SHARED/WEP, show UNKNOW/WEP in scan list.
12. When the secondary channel of AP exceeds the country region's range, station will auto fallback to 20MHz. i.e. need both control and secondary channel are both
        in country region's channel list.
13. Migrate Mesh supporting to Draft-2.0.
14. Support DLS
